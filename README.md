# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
One of the most prevalent diseases in today’s world is cancer among which breast 
cancer is caused by variety of clinical, lifestyle, social, and economic variables. Breast cancer has 
become the most recurrent type of health issue among women especially for women in middle age. 
Early detection of breast cancer can help women cure this disease and death rate can be reduced. 
The goal of this project is to predict breast cancer using machine learning algorithms.
Dataset:  For  this  project  we  have  chosen  the  Breast  Cancer  Wisconsin  Dataset  of  following 
attributes and features. 
The attributes are:

 ID number

 Diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

Ten real valued features are computed for each cell. They are:

 Radius

 Texture

 Perimeter

 Area

 Smoothness

 Compactness

 Concavity

 Concave points

 Symmetry

 Fractal Dimension

**Models:** We have tested and trained our datasets using 3 different models.
 
 Logistic  Regression  model:  Logistic  regression aims  to  solve  classification  problems.  It 
does  this  by  predicting  categorical  outcomes,  unlike  linear  regression  that  predicts  a 
continuous outcome.

 Decision  Tree  Classifier:  The  decision  tree  classifier  creates  the  classification  model  by 
building a decision tree. Each node in the tree specifies a test on an attribute, each branch 
descending from that node corresponds to one of the possible values for that attribute.
 
 Random  Forest  Classifier:  One  of  the  most  important  features  of  the  Random  Forest 
Algorithm is that it can handle the data set containing continuous variables as in the case 
of  regression  and  categorical  variables  as  in  the  case  of  classification. It  performs  better 
results for classification problems.
